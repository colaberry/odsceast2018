    "## Additive and Multiplicative Rules of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $A$,$B$ are two events, and $P$ denotes the probability of occurence of an event. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets define the events as:\n",
    "* $A$ - Rolling a 4 on a fair die\n",
    "* $B$ - Rolling a 3 on a fair die\n",
    "\n",
    "With these event definitions we can observe that occurrence of $A$ prevents the occurrence of $B$ (or any other event in the sample space). Hence such events are called Mutually Exclusive Events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Space of an Event\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample space is the set of all possible favorable outcomes of an event. In the above example, each of the events $A$ and $B$ have one outcome in their sample space.\n",
    "$A_0,A_1,A_2...A_n$ could be possible outcomes in the sample space of $A$ and similarly, $B_0,B_1,B_2...B_n$ be possible outcomes in the sample space of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I re-define $A$ and $B$ from above example as:\n",
    "* $A$ - Rolling an even number on a fair die\n",
    "* $B$ - Rolling an odd number on a fair die\n",
    "\n",
    "now the sample spaces of $A$ and $B$ each have 3 favorable outcomes each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additive Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The additive rule of probability says that, for two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of occurrence of either event A or event B can be defined as, the total of the probability of occurrence of event $A$ and the probability of occurrence of event $B$ minus the probability of occurrence of both $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events, i.e., there is no overlap in sample spaces of event $A$ and event $B$, then $P(A\\cap B)=0$. So,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering a set of mutually exclusive events, $A,B,C,D...$ so on, we can write additive rule as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A\\cup B \\cup C \\cup D...)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)+P(D)...$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplicative Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of drawing a ball from a bucket consisting of many different colored balls. For simplicity, consider that there are only two different colored balls - 6 Green balls and 4 Red balls, 10 balls in total. Now draws can be made in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* with replacement - The ball drawn in every single draw is kept back into the bucket, keeping the total number of balls and mixture of colored balls constant, from draw to draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "* without replacement - A ball drawn in a single draw is retained and not replaced or substituted in any way in the bucket. This changes total number of balls and mixture of balls with each draw. Note that with no replacement or substitution, the total number of single ball draws that can be made in the bucket would be equal to the total number of balls in the bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/bib.png\", style=\"height:60vh;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When balls are drawn without replacements, each draw affects the probabilities/outcomes of subsequent draws and say, the outcome of the second draw will be dependent upon the outcome of the first draw. In the same scenario, if balls are drawn with replacement, that is, every ball drawn is kept back into the bucket or is replaced with an identical ball, then every draw is independent of another/subsequent draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when the probability of occurrence of event A does not, in any way, affect the probability of occurrence of event B and vice versa, then A and B are said to be independent events (events whose probability of occurrence is independent of each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are \n",
    "\n",
    "* Tossing of two coins : Occurrence of heads in one coin is independent of occurrence of heads/tails in the second coin.\n",
    "* Rolling of two dice  : The number on one die does not in any way affect the number on rolling the second die.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/Independent_events.png\", style=\"height:60vh;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the <b>Multiplication Rule</b>, if $A$ and $B$ are two independent events then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability of occurence of event A given event B has occurred is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\large \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "But since $A$ and $B$ are independent events,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\large \\frac{P(A) * P(B)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to $A$ itself, which goes to show that occurrence or non-occurrence of $B$ does not affect the probability of occurrence of $A$ in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called <b>\"Conditional Independence\"</b> of event $A$ over event $B$."
